## 🧠 About Me

I’m a passionate and curious AI & Data Science student with a strong foundation in both theory and real-world application. I enjoy solving meaningful problems with machine learning, natural language processing, and automation. I love building smart systems that make human life easier — from predictive models to user-personalized AI apps.

With a unique blend of creativity and technical skill, I thrive in interdisciplinary environments where innovation and experimentation are encouraged. I’m also skilled in UI/UX design principles, academic writing, and agile development workflows.

I am constantly learning, iterating, and building. My goal is to contribute to technologies that are **explainable**, **scalable**, and **human-centered**.
